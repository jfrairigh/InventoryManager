# Inventory Manager
### Reason for creating:
I created this application for Software I at Western Governors University.

### What does it do?
It allows users to keep track of parts and products in their inventory.  A user may add, modify, or delete parts or products. The user interacts with the application through a graphical user interface.

### How to run the application:
* Ensure you have java version 1.8.0_251 or higher
* Download Inventory_Management.jar to your computer
* Double click on the file to execute it

I have also included the source code and configuration files from NetBeans. I used Netbeans version 8.2 and JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0 to create the application. You're welcome to download these files and modify them for your personal use.
